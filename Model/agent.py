"""
The Agent class provides most of the utility you need to manipulate the agent.
There are three movement options: move(), repulse_move(), and random_walk().
Currently, the agent can use either FSM or BT implementations, as the data
needed for both are initialized in its constructor.
NOTE: agent.neighbors is a list of int, each int corresponding to a neighbor's ID.
To query for a neighbor's info, call agent.sim.get_agent_x() (x being the info you want).
See simulation.py for what information can be retrieved.
